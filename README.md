Welcome to the PPA Advanced System Suite! This console application combines powerful financial calculation tools to help you manage and project your investments and track your daily financial performance.

## Core Modules:

### 1. 📈 PPA Calculator: Stock Passive Profit Projection
This tool allows you to easily and intuitively calculate the potential profit or loss of your stock investment. Enter key data such as initial price, weekly percentage change, units purchased, and analyst estimates to see how your investments might evolve over various periods.

### 2. 💰 Data Register: Daily Performance & Balance Tracker
Track your daily financial performance and maintain a running total balance. Start by entering your initial balance (e.g., from your salary), then log your net gains or losses each day. The system provides weekly and monthly summaries of your net performance.
